A collection of simple USD projects.

I'm organizing more USD examples in C++ [here](https://github.com/yoharol/USD_CPP_CMAKE).

**Basic** shows the most basic example to show how to create USD scene with primitives, references and how to add animation.

**Basic Mesh** extents the basic examples to mesh, especially the dynamic mesh.

**Features** highlight a single class or set of functions for working in USD.

**Concepts** take features explained in Features and extends them to real-world examples.

**Tricks** are simple, isolated ideas using USD Features.
